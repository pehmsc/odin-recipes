# odin-recipes

This repository has the main goal to let me practice all HTML I've learned so far with The Odin Project.
The website will consist of a main index page which have links to a few recipes. Won't look very pretty by the time I finished but it's important to keep in mind that the purpose of this project is to build HTML chops.
